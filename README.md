# About Me
## My interests 
<p> I love listening to music, binging TV shows and watching movies. I listen to everything on spotify and my most recent show binge was squid game season 2.</p>

## Websites I Recommend
    **[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)** - a requisite for people who visit the internet and want to learn things or just be entertained.
    **[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/films)** - Social media for movies: people leave reviews and ratings, make lists and follow others
    **[Cargo Site Builder](https://cargo.site)** - A site builder for creatives. Check out some sites that use cargo instead of squarespace or wix, they do not disappoint. They have way more interesting formatting and structure.
